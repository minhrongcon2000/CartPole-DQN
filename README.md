If you want to reproduce any results under ``results`` folder, please run the relevant file for the setup that you want to reproduce (for example, if you want to reproduce the result of agent with experience replay only, run ``train_dqn_with_replay_only.py``). If you want to test the agent, run ``test.py`` with the model name that you saved.
